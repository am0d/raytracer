### Raytracer (rt)

This is a small project that I am using to experiment with raytracing.
It really doesn't do much at the moment - it renders 2 spheres with diffuse lighting, and thats it.
However, I have grandiose plans for it - like anything else, we will have to wait and see how much of those plans are implemented.

## License

I'm not 100% certain of the license yet - if you want to do anything with this code, contact me and I will let you know (it will be similar to the GPL, but probably not quite as restrictive - I'm still researching the various licenses.
